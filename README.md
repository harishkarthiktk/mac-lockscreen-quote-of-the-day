Quote of the Day for Lock Screen
===============================
Forked from [mac-lockscreen-quote-of-the-day](https://github.com/mweisz/mac-lockscreen-quote-of-the-day)
- I will be adding further functionalities and implementation support.
- My main use case is to be able to rotate lock-screen message to custom messages, preferably from a text file or external data read through an API call.

## Introduction
Provides a 'Quote of the Day' feature for the logon/lock screen of OS X.
![alt text](https://github.com/harishkarthiktk/mac-lockscreen-quote-of-the-day/blob/master/docs/img/lock_screen.png "Login Screen with Random Quote")

## Features
- Â Read random line from provided text file and set it as lock screen message
-  Use publicly available quotation sources like Wikiquote.org

## Installation
Add the script to your log off hook, so that it will change your quote whenever you log off.
